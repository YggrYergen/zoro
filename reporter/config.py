"""
Configuration management for the reporter CLI.

This module centralizes loading of configuration values from environment
variables and JSON configuration files.  It defines sane defaults and
provides an interface for the rest of the application to query these
settings.

The configuration file `reporter_config.json` allows users to control
which files are included in the prompt.  For example, it can specify
patterns to include or exclude when traversing the project tree, and
limits on the number of lines or total characters per file.  If the
configuration file is absent, reasonable defaults are used.
 
Defaults are conservative and exclude common generated artifacts
(.venv, __pycache__, build, dist, egg-info, caches) and reporter outputs
(current_step.md, diff.patch).
